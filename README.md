# Chrome-Extension

This is a simple Chrome Extension that allows the user to save webpages in a single list for easy retrieving should you need that same oage again. 

It's still a work a progress but can be added to your Chrome locally and you start using it. Just simply download the files and save them in a path it's easy to find then open Chrome and go to settings, then extensions and yoi can then add it.
