==================
## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
The team was inspired to create PennyWise due to the prevailing numbers of students seen on a daily basis that struggle with their finances and not knowing where or what their money is spent on. We saw this as an opportunity to create PennyWise in order to help students make informed financial decisions.

## ðŸ¤” Purpose
PennyWise is designed to be your next best friend who helps you keep track of your expenses as well as stay on track your spending, where you are spending it and help you stay within your financial budget.

## What it does
PennyWise helps students stay above their finances in terms of creating a platform that they can use to track all their expenses and income budget. It also ensures that students stay within their student.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design
We were heavily inspired by the revised version of Double Diamond design process, which not only includes visual design, but a full-fledged research cycle in which you must discover and define your problem before tackling your solution & then finally deploy it.

> 1. Discover: a deep dive into the problem we are trying to solve.
> 2. Define: synthesizing the information from the discovery phase into a problem definition.
> 3. Develop: think up solutions to the problem.
> 4. Deliver: pick the best solution and build that.

PennyWise was designed using hand-drawn wireframes and the work was then split into frontend and backend, with each teammate working on a particular feature.
